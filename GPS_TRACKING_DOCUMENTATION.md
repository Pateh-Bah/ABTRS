## Development Notes

### Adding New Features
1. Extend models in `gps_tracking/models.py`
2. Create migrations: `python manage.py makemigrations gps_tracking`
3. Add views in `gps_tracking/views.py`
4. Update URL patterns in `gps_tracking/urls.py`
5. Create/update templates in `templates/gps_tracking/`

### GPS Data Integration
The system is designed to integrate with real GPS hardware devices. Location updates can be sent via:
- REST API endpoints

- Add new geofence area types

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Google Maps not loading**: Check API key configuration
2. **Location updates not working**: Verify API permissions
3. **Driver dashboard access denied**: Ensure driver profile exists
4. **Speed alerts not triggering**: Check speed limit configuration

### Database Issues
- Ensure all migrations are applied
- Check foreign key relationships
- Verify user roles and permissions

## Future Enhancements
