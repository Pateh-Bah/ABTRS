🔧 GPS Tracking Fixes Applied:

✅ JavaScript initialization order fixed
   - Added proper Google Maps API loading sequence
   - Added error handling for failed API loads
   - Added loading indicator during map initialization

✅ Marker function error fixed  
   - Added safety checks before calling marker.setMap()
   - Fixed updateMapMarkers() to check if Google Maps is loaded
   - Added try-catch error handling around map operations

✅ Bus icon improvements
   - Custom SVG icons with prominent bus IDs
   - Color coding: Green=Moving, Red=Stopped  
   - Online status indicator in corner

✅ API integration verified
   - Bus locations API returns proper JSON format
   - Field names match between API and frontend
   - Error messages displayed to users

📍 Test Instructions:
1. Visit http://127.0.0.1:9000/gps/
2. Map should load without "marker.setMap is not a function" error
3. Bus icons should appear with IDs 1, 2, 3 clearly visible
4. Clicking icons shows bus details with driver names

🚌 Available Test Drivers:
- driver1 / password123 → Bus ID 1
- driver2 / password123 → Bus ID 2  
- driver3 / password123 → Bus ID 3

The "Failed to load bus locations: marker.setMap is not a function" error
has been resolved through proper JavaScript initialization timing.
