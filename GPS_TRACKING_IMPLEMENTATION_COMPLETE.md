# GPS Tracking System - Implementation Complete

## ‚úÖ Issues Resolved

### 1. GPS Management Visibility Fixed
- **Problem**: GPS Management was only visible to admin users
- **Solution**: Modified `templates/base_nav.html` to show GPS Management for ALL authenticated users
- **Change**: Replaced `{% if user.is_admin or user.is_staff_member %}` with `{% if user.is_authenticated %}`

### 2. Google Maps API Integration Fixed
- **Problem**: "This page didn't load Google Maps correctly" error
- **Solution**: 
  - Added Google Maps API key configuration in `wakafine_bus/settings.py`
  - Created comprehensive GPS tracking views with proper API key passing
  - Implemented error handling for Google Maps loading failures

### 3. Missing View Classes Fixed
- **Problem**: `BusTrackingMapView` and other view classes didn't exist, causing AttributeError
- **Solution**: Created complete `gps_tracking/views.py` with all required view classes:
  - `BusTrackingMapView` - Public GPS tracking map
  - `BusDetailView` - Individual bus tracking details
  - `AdminGPSManagementView` - Admin dashboard
  - `AdminBusLocationListView` - Admin bus location list
  - `SpeedAlertListView` - Speed alert management
